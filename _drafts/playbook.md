## Simplification beats optimization

The easiest way to ensure that a "system" endures is to keep it simple. Super simple. The simpler it is, the easier it is to follow.

Some examples where I have super-simplified my life:

1. Investing:
2. Clothes:
3. No caffeine, no sugar, no alcohol, no tobacco, no drugs, no junk food, no processed food, no fast food, no soda, no soft drinks, no junk TV, no junk news, no junk social media, no junk internet, no junk email, no junk phone calls, no junk text messages, no junk mail, no junk ads, no junk anything.
4. commute, not owning a car

will power is in limited supply
purpose, focus
minimalism
reduces cognitive load
team communication
optimize only when
simplicity is related to energy levels
start simple, then optimize
simplicity eliminates "baggage"/"side-effects": no alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes, etc

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* energy management vs time management
* association programming, environments, create a pit of success
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
  * content: books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc
  * note: avoid renting out your time, it prevents scaling
* relying on gut/intuition
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
* reducing orders of ignorance
* situational awareness
* small bets
* deep work, deep focus, avoid distractions
* prioritize yourself first, the selfishness illusion
