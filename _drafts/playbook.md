Based on my life experiences, I've cobbled together this playbook that has helped me in my growth/development. This is mostly for my own reference, but I hope it helps you too (disclaimer: your mileage may vary).

Most of the things in this playbook aren't my original ideas; they're mostly things I've learned & imbibed from various books, podcasts, TED talks, YouTube videos, documentaries, friends, mentors, co-workers, and what have you (I've tried to give credit where it's due). But everything in this playbook has been tried, tested and proven to work **for me**. Again, your mileage may vary.

I intend for this to be a living document that I hope to update & tweak every now and then.

## Conquer fear

My growth has mostly come from doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as a "fear" is generally a brain cocktail blended from fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust and many more ingredients.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by BrenÃ© Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

When dealing with fears, I take solace in these two facts:

*Almost EVERYTHING seems scary the first time around*: Driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out, hiring someone, purchasing a home, yada yada. Once I take some action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

*Most fears are just imaginary/irrational*: As soon as I take some action, I realize that:

* the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. or
* the probability of anything bad happening is extremely low. or
* should anything bad happen I can handle/mitigate it. or
* should anything bad happen I can recover from it. or
* I can prevent anything bad from happening in the first place.

The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks.

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* goal vs system
* simplification vs optimization
* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
