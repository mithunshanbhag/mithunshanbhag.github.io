Based on my life experiences, I've cobbled together this playbook that has helped me in my growth/development. This is mostly for my own reference, but I hope it helps you too (disclaimer: your mileage may vary).

Most of the things in this playbook aren't my original ideas; they're mostly things I've imbibed from various books, podcasts, TED talks, YouTube videos, documentaries, friends, mentors, co-workers, and what have you (I've tried to give credit where it's due). But everything in this playbook has been tried, tested and proven to work **for me**. Again, your mileage may vary.

I intend for this to be a living document that I hope to update & tweak every now and then.

## 1. Conquer fear

>
> "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage." - Anais Nin

I can attribute most of my growth to doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as a "fear" is generally a brain cocktail blended from fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust and many more ingredients.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by BrenÃ© Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

-----

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

   As an example, I have a (possibly irrationally) paranoia about losing my phone. So I did a simple fear-setting exercise, documenting the worst case outcomes, and the steps that I can take to prevent/mitigate them ([LINK]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-02-25-preparing-for-device-loss %})).

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

When dealing with fears, I take solace in these two facts:

1. *Almost EVERYTHING seems scary the first time around*: Driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out, hiring someone, purchasing a home, yada yada. Once I take some action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

2. *Most fears are just imaginary/irrational*: As soon as I take some action, I realize that:

   * the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. or
   * the probability of anything bad happening is extremely low. or
   * should anything bad happen I can handle/mitigate it. or
   * should anything bad happen I can recover from it. or
   * I can prevent anything bad from happening in the first place.

The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks.

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## 2. Systems over goals

>
> "Systems are for people who care about winning repeatedly. Goals are for people who care about winning once." - James Clear
>
> "Losers have goals. Winners have systems." - Scott Adams
>

In my early 30s, I was super-obsessed with hitting goals & checking off bucket-list items: weight goals, marathon running goals, bench/squat/deadlift goals, countries & places to visit, list of books to read, salary goals, job title goals, career goals, restaurants to try out, net worth goals, hobbies to try out, you name it! <@TODO: More examples>.

I would set goals, and then I would religiously track my progress towards those goals.

And it would ALWAYS end with me getting frustrated; either because I failed to make progress towards those goals, or because I failed to achieve those goals. But mostly because I lost track of why I had those goals in the first place.

Also, if a goal was achieved, my motivation to keep going would just drop off a cliff. Goals were temporary, they simply didn't endure.

-----

[Scott Adams' advice on 'goals vs systems'](https://www.amazon.in/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/0241003709) was an eye-opener for me. Goals are just a means to an end. They're not the end in themselves.

Instead of creating a goal, you need to create a system: a habit you execute repeatedly, over and over again. A daily practice of sorts. A boring, predictable, consistent routine. The critical word here is 'repeatedly', the benefits of a system compounds over the long run.

Some examples:

1. [Tim Ferriss' morning routine](https://tim.blog/2017/03/21/tim-ferriss-morning-routine/).

## Simplification beats optimization

The easiest way to ensure that a "system" endures is to keep it simple. Super simple. The simpler it is, the easier it is to follow.

Some examples where I have super-simplified my life:

1. Investing:
2. Clothes:
3. No caffeine, no sugar, no alcohol, no tobacco, no drugs, no junk food, no processed food, no fast food, no soda, no soft drinks, no junk TV, no junk news, no junk social media, no junk internet, no junk email, no junk phone calls, no junk text messages, no junk mail, no junk ads, no junk anything.
4. commute, not owning a car

will power is in limited supply
purpose, focus
minimalism
reduces cognitive load
team communication
optimize only when
simplicity is related to energy levels
start simple, then optimize
simplicity eliminates "baggage"/"side-effects": no alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes, etc

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

>

> "Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life." - Jerzy Gregorek

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
  * note: avoid renting out your time, it prevents scaling
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
* orders of ignorance
* situational awareness
* small bets
