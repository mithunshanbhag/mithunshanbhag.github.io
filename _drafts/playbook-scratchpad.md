## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* anti-fragility (stress to the system), being uncomfortable

## Applying leverage

* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code) / skills
  * social media
  * team/org
  * labour
  * content: books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc
  * alumni network
  * note: avoid renting out your time, it prevents scaling

If you need to scale, you cannot be a bottleneck.

## Maximizing your focus

* Growing your focus required intentional exercises. Exactly like physical exercises.
* You're super intentional about what you feed your body. Do the same for your mind.
* Social media is junk food for the brain.
* Social media is like lays chips. No one can eat just one. Hence doom scrolling follows.
* Control/regulate your inputs

-----

* energy management vs time management
* association programming, environments, create a pit of success
* deciding vs wanting
* relying on gut/intuition
* go after the toughest problems to solve. Don't be in a supporting role. Be a Messi/Ronaldo. Get the bacon for your team.
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
* reducing orders of ignorance
* situational awareness
* small bets
* deep work, deep focus, avoid distractions
* prioritize yourself first, the selfishness illusion
* prioritizing: important vs urgent
* inbound, not outbound. make them come to you. don't go to them. pull, not push. get pursued, don't pursue.
* purpose, focus (maximizing your focus)
* saying no often (in order to pick the right opportunity, in order to prioritize yourself)
* solution should not be more complex than the problem you're trying to solve.

Some principles (these are not really habits/systems):

* hold options, hold the power. your loyalty is to yourself.
* if it is important to you, you will find a way. if not, you'll find an excuse.
* hold frame
