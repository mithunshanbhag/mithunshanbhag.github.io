## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* anti-fragility (stress to the system), being uncomfortable

## Applying leverage

* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code) / skills
  * social media
  * team/org
  * labour
  * content: books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc
  * alumni network
  * note: avoid renting out your time, it prevents scaling

If you need to scale, you cannot be a bottleneck.

## Maximizing your focus

Just training your brain to stay focused on the task at hand gives you a massive advantage over distracted people. It's almost a super-power or cheat-code of sorts. Feels unfair even. ðŸ¤·

* Growing your focus required intentional exercises. Exactly like physical exercises.
* You're super intentional about what you feed your body. Do the same for your mind.
* Social media is junk food for the brain.
* Social media is like lays chips. No one can eat just one. Hence doom scrolling follows.
* Control/regulate your inputs
* deep work, deep focus, avoid distractions

In order to maximize focus, you have to minimize distractions. If you can afford it, throw money at these 'distractions' to make them go away. How do you know if you can afford to do so? I use Naval's rule: I have an internal billing rate for my time. I multiply this billing rate by the time taken up by these distractions. This is the time I could be billing my clients. If the time taken up by these distractions is more than the time I could be billing my clients, then I can afford to throw money at these distractions to make them go away. <@TODO: Refine this>

* Embrace boredom

## Managing your environment

We need to create our personal **pit of success**, that we'll ultimately fall into.

* gym, walking trail
* dedicated office space (home vs office, separation of concerns)
* regular meal times
* sound sleep
* hydration

-----

* energy management vs time management
* association programming, environments, create a pit of success
* deciding vs wanting
* relying on gut/intuition
* go after the toughest problems to solve. Don't be in a supporting role. Be a Messi/Ronaldo. Get the bacon for your team.
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
* reducing orders of ignorance
* situational awareness
* small bets
* prioritize yourself first, the selfishness illusion
* prioritizing: important vs urgent
* inbound, not outbound. make them come to you. don't go to them. pull, not push. get pursued, don't pursue.
* purpose, focus (maximizing your focus)
* saying no often (in order to pick the right opportunity, in order to prioritize yourself)
* solution should not be more complex than the problem you're trying to solve.

Some principles (these are not really habits/systems):

* hold options, hold the power. your loyalty is to yourself.
* if it is important to you, you will find a way. if not, you'll find an excuse.
* hold frame
