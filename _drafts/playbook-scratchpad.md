Just training your brain to stay focused on the task at hand gives you a massive advantage over distracted people. It's almost a super-power or cheat-code of sorts. Feels unfair even. ðŸ¤·

* Growing your focus required intentional exercises. Exactly like physical exercises.
* You're super intentional about what you feed your body. Do the same for your mind.
* Social media is junk food for the brain.
* Social media is like lays chips. No one can eat just one. Hence doom scrolling follows.
* Control/regulate your inputs
* deep work, deep focus, avoid distractions

In order to maximize focus, you have to minimize distractions. If you can afford it, throw money at these 'distractions' to make them go away. How do you know if you can afford to do so? I use Naval's rule: I have an internal billing rate for my time. I multiply this billing rate by the time taken up by these distractions. This is the time I could be billing my clients. If the time taken up by these distractions is more than the time I could be billing my clients, then I can afford to throw money at these distractions to make them go away. <@TODO: Refine this>

## Becoming irreplaceable

By Cal Newport from his book 'So Good They Can't Ignore You'):

Rules:

1. Don't follow your passion.
2. Be so good they can't ignore you.
   1. Be a craftsman.
   2. deliberate practice.
3. Turn down a promotion.
   1. Be in control of your time
   2. Don't rent out your time
4. Think small, act big.


Compounding and scaling yourself

So, you've seen that famous venn diagram that says you should find the intersection of what you're good at, what pays well, and what you're passionate about?

Well, let me give you a different one; mine says you should find the intersection of what you're good at, what pays well, and what you're irreplaceable at (@todo: no competition exists).

Career capital = credibility = track record = irreplaceable = reputation = brand = legacy = compounding

The way I see it:

1. You have to compound yourself with the RIGHT people/team, skills, environment.

2. You can't compound yourself in a vacuum; you HAVE to make yourself useful to others. Else you're just compounding the wrong things.

3. You have to accept that some things compound faster than others. And some things won't compound; you have to cut your losses and move on. Be patient and trust the process.

4. There has to be some feedback loop. You have to be able to measure your progress. You have to be able to see the results of your compounding efforts.

Some skills you've compounded throughout your lifetime or career will become irrelevant. Often overnight, when huge seismic shifts happen in the landscape (e.g. the internet, the pandemic, rise of AI, etc). You have to be able to pivot and adapt. You have to be able to unlearn and relearn. You have to be able to compound new skills.

Landscapes will shifts, often overnight. You have to adapt and pivot.

Be hard to compete with

deliberate practice.

## Applying leverage

* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code) / skills
  * social media
  * team/org
  * labour
  * content: books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc
  * alumni network
  * note: avoid renting out your time, it prevents scaling

If you need to scale, you cannot be a bottleneck.

Research 'career capital' (from Cal Newport's book 'So Good They Can't Ignore You').

## Managing your environment

We need to create our personal **pit of success**, that we'll ultimately fall into.

* gym, walking trail
* dedicated office space (home vs office, separation of concerns)
* regular meal times
* sound sleep
* hydration

We need to design our environment to make the right behaviors easier and the wrong behaviors harder.

* [Lewin's Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewin%27s_equation)

Visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. A small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.

Surface (increase your exposure to) the visual cues for good habits. Hide (reduce your exposure to) the visual cues for bad habits.

If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, then make the cue a big part of your environment.

What are some must haves while designing your environment for productivity?

When designing your environment for productivity, there are several must-haves that can help optimize your focus, organization, and efficiency. Here are some key elements to consider:

    Clutter-free workspace: A clean and organized workspace can significantly impact your ability to concentrate and be productive. Keep your desk or work area free from unnecessary items and clutter. Use storage solutions, such as file organizers or drawers, to maintain order and ensure easy access to essential materials.

    Ergonomic setup: Pay attention to ergonomics to create a comfortable and supportive workspace. Invest in a good chair that promotes proper posture, position your computer monitor at eye level, and arrange your desk and keyboard in a way that minimizes strain on your body. A comfortable environment can help you avoid discomfort and distractions, allowing you to focus better on your tasks.

    Adequate lighting: Ensure that your workspace has sufficient lighting. Natural light is ideal, as it has been shown to boost mood and productivity. Position your desk near a window if possible. If natural light is limited, use artificial lighting that provides a bright, yet glare-free, illumination.

    Personalized organization system: Establish an organizational system that works for you. This may include physical tools like folders, binders, or labels, as well as digital tools like productivity apps or project management software. Find a system that helps you keep track of tasks, deadlines, and important documents effectively.

    Distraction minimization: Minimize potential distractions in your environment to maintain focus. Consider removing or limiting access to distractions such as social media apps or websites that tend to consume your attention. Use website blockers or productivity apps to help you stay on track. Additionally, set boundaries with colleagues or family members to minimize interruptions during dedicated work periods.

    Inspiring elements: Incorporate elements in your environment that inspire and motivate you. This could be artwork, motivational quotes, plants, or any objects that have personal significance or evoke positive emotions. Such elements can help create a pleasant and uplifting atmosphere that enhances your productivity.

    Productive tools and technology: Equip your workspace with the necessary tools and technology to support your work. This may include a reliable computer, high-speed internet connection, essential software applications, a comfortable keyboard and mouse, and any other tools specific to your work or industry.

Remember, everyone's preferences and needs may vary, so it's important to design your environment in a way that aligns with your personal preferences and work style. Regularly evaluate and refine your workspace to ensure it continues to support your productivity and well-being.


Make that productivity and focus

Certainly! Here are some additional elements to consider specifically for enhancing productivity and focus in your environment:

    Dedicated workspace: Designate a specific area solely for work or focused tasks. Having a dedicated workspace helps create a mental boundary between work and leisure activities, signaling your brain to enter a productive state when you're in that space.

    Noise control: Minimize noise distractions as much as possible. If you work in a noisy environment, consider using noise-canceling headphones or playing white noise or instrumental music to create a more serene auditory environment. Experiment to find the level of background noise that helps you concentrate best.

    Time management tools: Utilize tools that assist with time management and productivity. These can include timers, productivity apps, or task management systems that help you prioritize and allocate time effectively. Set specific goals and deadlines for your work to stay focused and motivated.

    Minimalism: Adopt a minimalist approach to your workspace, keeping only essential items within reach. A clutter-free environment reduces visual distractions and allows you to maintain a clear and focused mindset.

    Comfortable temperature: Ensure that your workspace is at a comfortable temperature. Extreme heat or cold can be distracting and affect your ability to concentrate. Adjust the temperature or use fans, heaters, or blankets to create an environment conducive to productivity.

    Mindful color choices: Different colors can impact your mood and focus. Choose colors that promote productivity and concentration, such as cool blues or neutral tones. Experiment with color schemes that help you feel calm and engaged in your workspace.

    Inspiring and personal elements: Surround yourself with items that inspire and motivate you, such as vision boards, meaningful quotes, or photographs. Personalize your workspace with items that reflect your values, goals, or achievements, serving as reminders of what you're working towards.

    Proper ventilation: Good air quality is essential for maintaining focus and alertness. Ensure that your workspace is well-ventilated with fresh air circulation. Open windows if possible, use air purifiers if needed, and introduce indoor plants to enhance air quality.

What are the environments that you need to design/manage for peak productivity

To optimize your productivity, there are several environments you may need to design or manage. These environments include:

    Physical workspace: This refers to your immediate physical surroundings, such as your home office, desk, or workspace in a shared office. Design and organize this space to minimize distractions, ensure comfort, and promote focus.

    Digital workspace: Your digital environment encompasses your computer, smartphone, and digital tools. Organize your files, folders, and desktop to reduce digital clutter. Utilize productivity apps, project management tools, and email management systems to streamline your digital workflow.

    Time management environment: Effectively managing your time is crucial for productivity. Create an environment that supports time management by using calendars, planners, or task management systems. Set clear priorities, establish routines, and minimize time-wasting activities to maximize productivity.

    Social environment: Your social environment includes the people you interact with regularly, such as colleagues, friends, or family members. Surround yourself with individuals who support and encourage your productivity goals. Seek accountability partners or join communities that foster a productive mindset.

    Online environment: With the prevalence of digital communication and remote work, managing your online environment is crucial. Organize your email inbox, use filters and labels to manage incoming messages, and set boundaries for online availability and communication. Limit distractions from social media or non-work-related websites by using website blockers or dedicated browsing sessions.

    Mobile environment: As mobile devices have become an integral part of our lives, managing your mobile environment is essential. Organize your apps, create folders, and remove unnecessary or distracting apps from your device. Use productivity apps, timers, or focus-enhancing tools on your mobile device to support your productivity goals.

    Physical well-being environment: Your physical well-being directly affects your productivity. Design an environment that supports your health by incorporating elements such as exercise equipment, ergonomic furniture, healthy snacks, and proper hydration. Ensure you have a conducive environment for restful sleep, as quality sleep contributes to optimal productivity.

    Mindset environment: Cultivate a positive and focused mindset to enhance productivity. Surround yourself with motivational quotes, books, or resources that inspire you. Design a mental environment that supports resilience, goal setting, and a growth mindset.

Remember, these environments are interconnected, and optimizing one can positively impact others. Regularly assess and adjust your environments to align with your productivity goals and preferences. Experiment with different strategies, tools, and systems to find what works best for you.

## Be uncomfortable

>
> "Don't get comfortable." - American Giant
>
> "Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life." - Jerzy Gregorek
>
> "If you want to live a life you've never lived, then you have to do things you've never done." - Jen Sincero
>

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

Some amount of stress is good.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* anti-fragility (stress to the system), being uncomfortable

## Making yourself useful

TBD

-----


* energy management vs time management
* association programming, environments, create a pit of success
* deciding vs wanting
* relying on gut/intuition
* go after the toughest problems to solve. Don't be in a supporting role. Be a Messi/Ronaldo. Get the bacon for your team.
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
* reducing orders of ignorance
* situational awareness
* small bets
* prioritize yourself first, the selfishness illusion
* prioritizing: important vs urgent
* inbound, not outbound. make them come to you. don't go to them. pull, not push. get pursued, don't pursue.
* purpose, focus (maximizing your focus)
* saying no often (in order to pick the right opportunity, in order to prioritize yourself)
* solution should not be more complex than the problem you're trying to solve.

Some principles (these are not really habits/systems):

* hold options, hold the power. your loyalty is to yourself.
* if it is important to you, you will find a way. if not, you'll find an excuse.
* hold frame
