## Conquer fear

>

My biggest growth has come from doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as a "fear" is generally a brain cocktail blended from fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust and many more ingredients.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by BrenÃ© Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

   I soon realize that the worst-case scenario is not as bad as I thought it'd be. Or that the my fears were just irrational. Or that the probability of anything happening is extremely low. Or that I can handle/mitigate it if anything does happen. Or that I can recover from it if it does happen. Or that I can prevent it from happening in the first place.

   I take solace in the fact that almost everything seems scary the first time around (e.g. driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out). Once I take action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

   The more I face my fears, the more it shrinks. The more I do it, the easier it gets. The more I do it, the more I realize that my fears were probably never real. The more I do it, the more I realize that I'm capable of doing things I never thought I could do.

<@TODO: Some fears have playbooks: moving countries>
<@TODO: Some fears don't have playbooks>
<@TODO: My fear tends to be in these two categories: irrational, first-time/unfamiliarity>

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* goal vs system
* simplification vs optimization
* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
