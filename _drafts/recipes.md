## Conquer your fears

>

My biggest growth has come from doing things that **initially** scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as a "fear" is generally a brain salad made from the following ingredients: fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness (aside: I highly recommend the books by Bren√© Brown and Chip Conley on these fascinating topics).

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take our fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

Two things can help us tremendously in this regard:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

   I soon realize that the worst-case scenario is not as bad as I thought it'd be. Or that the my fears were just irrational. Or that the probability of anything happening is extremely low. Or that I can handle/mitigate it if anything does happen. Or that I can recover from it if it does happen. Or that I can prevent it from happening in the first place.

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. We can take solace in the fact that everything seems scary only the first time around (e.g. driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out). Once we take action, we'll realize our fears aren't as bad as we thought they'd be.

   The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks. The more we do it, the easier it gets. The more we do it, the more we realize that the fears were probably never real. The more we do it, the more we realize that we're capable of doing things we never thought we could do.

<@TODO: Some fears don't have playbooks>

Crucially, conquering your fears lowers the barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* goal vs system
* simplification vs optimization
* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
