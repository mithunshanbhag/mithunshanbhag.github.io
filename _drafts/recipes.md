The only productivity "tool" you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap.

Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating.

* goal vs system
* simplification vs optimization
* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
