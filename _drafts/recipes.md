## Being courageous = acknowledging your fears, defining them, facing them, taking action, conquering them

My biggest growth has come from doing things that *INITIALLY* scared me; the critical word being *INITIALLY*: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

I had to acknowledge my fears, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them. There was no workaround for this.

Two things that have helped me in this regard:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process around this.

   * First you acknowledge and write down your fears.
   * Then you write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then write down what you'll do should that worst case scenario materialize.

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends taking SOME action. ANY action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take solace in the fact that everything seems scary only the first time around (e.g. driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out). Once you take action, you'll realize the fears weren't as bad as you thought they'd be.

You'll realize that the worst-case scenario is not as bad as you thought it'd be. Or that the fears were just irrational. Or that the probability of it happening is extremely low. Or that you can handle it if it does happen. Or that you can mitigate the damage if it does happen. Or that you can recover from it if it does happen. Or that you can prevent it from happening in the first place.

The more you face your fears, the more it shrinks. The more you do it, the easier it gets. The more you do it, the more you realize that the fears were probably never real. The more you do it, the more you realize that you're capable of doing things you never thought you could do.

<@TODO: Some fears don't have playbooks>

<@TODO: fears vs shame>

<@TODO: fears comes from unknown>

<@TODO: fears vs anxiety: unknown vs uncertain>

Crucially, conquering your fears lowers the barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Be uncomfortable, stress is good

The only productivity tool you need is the habit of getting uncomfortable & critical things done and out of the way asap. Apps, reminders, to-do lists while useful, are ultimately pointless if you're just gonna keep procrastinating to avoid stressful situations.

When stressed, follow Jeff Bezos' advice: Take some action. Any action.

* goal vs system
* simplification vs optimization
* energy management vs time management
* association programming
* deciding vs wanting
* leverage (how to get 10X output for 1X input, scaling)
  * capital/money
  * knowledge/specialization
  * tech (code)
  * social media
  * labour
* relying on gut/intuition
* fear setting
* anti-fragility (stress to the system)
* dates, deadlines, calendar, trello, visualization
* not depending on others, being fully independent
* owning a business (or a part of it or equity in it)
  * You can't get wildly rich by working for someone else and drawing a salary/income.
