So recently I switched on dark-mode for most of my frequently used apps (desktop, mobile & web). My eyes feel considerably less strained (especially at night). Can't believe it took me this long to switch!

## Apps that don't yet support dark mode

Here's hoping that the apps below release dark-mode support soon!

* Chrome _(unfortunately chrome [doesn't yet](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-windows-10-dark-mode/) support dark mode. However I found the [dark reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en) extension to be more that useful. Thanks [@nileshtrivedi](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi) for the recommendation)_.
* GMail android app
* Slack
* Microsoft Office family: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote etc
* SQL Server Management Studio
* WhatsApp
