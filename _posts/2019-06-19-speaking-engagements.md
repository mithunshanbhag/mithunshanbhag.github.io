I often speak at meetup groups and tech conferences targeted at software developers and devops engineers. Just like my blog posts, my talks are mostly centered on open-source, cross-platform technologies driven by Microsoft _(.net core, asp.net core, azure cloud, powershell core, typescript etc)_. 

Slides from my talks are [uploaded on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/mithunshanbhag/presentations).
