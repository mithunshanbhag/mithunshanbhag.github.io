Based on my life experiences, I've cobbled together this playbook that has helped me in my growth/development. This is mostly for my own reference, but I hope it helps you too (disclaimer: I make no guarantees).

Most of the things in this playbook aren't my original ideas; they're mostly things I've imbibed from various books, podcasts, TED talks, YouTube videos, documentaries, friends, mentors, co-workers, and what have you (I've tried to give credit where it's due). But everything in this playbook has been tried, tested and proven to work **for me**. Again, your mileage may vary.

I intend for this to be a living document that I hope to update & tweak every now and then.

## 1. Systems over goals

In my early 30s, I was super-obsessed with hitting goals & checking off bucket-list items: weight goals, marathon running goals, bench/squat/deadlift goals, countries & places to visit, list of books to read, salary goals, job title goals, career goals, restaurants to try out, net worth goals, hobbies to try out, you name it!

I would set goals, and then I would religiously track my progress towards those goals.

And it would ALWAYS end with me getting frustrated; either because I failed to make progress towards those goals, or because I failed to achieve those goals. But mostly because I lost track of why I had those goals in the first place.

Also, if a goal was achieved, my motivation to keep going would just drop off a cliff. Goals were temporary, they simply didn't endure.

[Scott Adams' advice on 'goals vs systems'](https://www.amazon.in/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/0241003709) was an eye-opener for me. Goals are just a means to an end. They're not the end in themselves.

Instead of creating a goal, you need to create a system: a habit you execute repeatedly, over and over again. A daily practice of sorts. A boring, predictable, consistent routine. The critical word here is 'repeatedly', the benefits of a system compounds over the long run.

Some examples:

## 2. Conquer fear

>

I can attribute most of my growth to doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as a "fear" is generally a brain cocktail blended from fear, anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust and many more ingredients.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by BrenÃ© Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

   As an example, I have a (possibly irrationally) paranoia about losing my phone. So I did a simple fear-setting exercise, documenting the worst case outcomes, and the steps that I can take to prevent/mitigate them ([LINK]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-02-25-preparing-for-device-loss %})).

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

When dealing with fears, I take solace in these two facts:

1. *Almost EVERYTHING seems scary the first time around*: Driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out, hiring someone, purchasing a home, yada yada. Once I take some action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

2. *Most fears are just imaginary/irrational*: As soon as I take some action, I realize that:

   * the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. or
   * the probability of anything bad happening is extremely low. or
   * should anything bad happen I can handle/mitigate it. or
   * should anything bad happen I can recover from it. or
   * I can prevent anything bad from happening in the first place.

The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks.

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.
