Based on my life experiences, I've cobbled together this playbook that has helped me in my growth/development. This is mostly for my own reference, but I hope it helps you too (disclaimer: I make no guarantees).

Most of the things in this playbook aren't my original ideas; they're mostly things I've imbibed from various books, podcasts, TED talks, YouTube videos, documentaries, friends, mentors, co-workers, and what have you (I've tried to give credit where it's due). But everything in this playbook has been tried, tested and proven to work **for me**. Again, your mileage may vary.

I intend for this to be a living document that I hope to update & tweak every now and then.

## Systems over goals

In my early 30s, I was super-obsessed with hitting goals & checking off bucket-list items: weight goals, marathon running goals, bench/squat/deadlift goals, countries & places to visit, list of books to read, salary goals, job title goals, career goals, restaurants to try out, net worth goals, hobbies to try out, you name it!

I would set goals, and then I would religiously track my progress towards those goals.

And it would ALWAYS end with me getting frustrated!

* Either because I failed to make progress towards those goals.
* Or because I failed to achieve those goals.
* But mostly because I lost track of why I had those goals in the first place.
* Also, if a goal was achieved, my motivation to keep going would just drop off a cliff.

Goals were temporary, they simply didn't endure.

[Scott Adams' advice on 'goals vs systems'](https://www.amazon.in/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/0241003709) was an eye-opener for me. Goals are just a means to an end. They're not the end in themselves.

Instead of creating goals, we need to create systems: something we execute repeatedly, over and over again. The critical word here is 'repeatedly'; the benefits of a system compound only over a long run. There are almost no visible short-term gains, and there almost certainly will be pains in the near term.

For a system to endure, it needs to be consistently executed. The more predictable and boring a system is, the better. The more automated a system is, the better. We have to take will-power out of the equation (cause we only have a very finite supply of it).

With systems, we're creating our personal **pit of success**, that we'll ultimately fall into.

> Aside: The words 'systems', 'habits', 'routines', 'practices', 'rituals, 'frameworks', 'trainings' etc. are all synonyms for me. I use them interchangeably.

-----

I'm not going to regurgitate what Scott Adams has already said in his book, but I'll give a few examples of systems that have worked for me:

Financial systems: Someday, I'll do a deep-dive on these, but for now, I'll just briefly mention them: diversifying income streams, regular SIP investing, creating an emergency fund, creating a succession plan (will), getting insured (health & term/life), and saving on taxes.

Productivity systems: Our productivity is a mostly function of two things: our ability to pick the right things to do, and our ability to getting those things done fast. Some systems that apply here: [taking small bets](#taking-small-bets), [letting simplicity win](#letting-simplicity-win), [conquering fear](#conquering-fear), [maximizing energy](#maximizing-energy), [maximizing focus](#maximizing-focus), [being uncomfortable](#being-uncomfortable) and [applying leverage](#applying-leverage).

> Aside: Yes, some of these systems may seem a bit "out there" (for lack of a better word). I'll expound more on them in the coming sections. Stick with me, it's well worth it. Read on.

## Conquering fear

>
> "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage." - Anais Nin
>

I can attribute most of my growth to doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as **fear** is generally a brain cocktail blended from multiple ingredients: anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust, and many more. Yes, and fear itself.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by Brené Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

-----

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

   As an example, I have a (possibly irrationally) paranoia about losing my phone. So I did a simple fear-setting exercise, documenting the worst case outcomes, and the steps that I can take to prevent/mitigate them ([LINK]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-02-25-preparing-for-device-loss %})).

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

When dealing with fears, I take solace in these two facts:

1. *Almost EVERYTHING seems scary the first time around*: Driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out, hiring someone, purchasing a home, yada yada. Once I take some action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

2. *Most fears are just imaginary/irrational*: As soon as I take some action, I realize that:

   * the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. or
   * the probability of anything bad happening is extremely low. or
   * should anything bad happen I can handle/mitigate it. or
   * should anything bad happen I can recover from it. or
   * I can prevent anything bad from happening in the first place.

The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks.

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Letting simplicity win

> "Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance." - Coco Chanel

The easiest way to ensure that a "system" endures is to keep it simple. Super, brain-dead simple. The simpler it is, the easier it is to follow that system.

In Scott Adams' book, he dichotomizes people as either simplifiers or as optimizers. And he argues that we'd be better off if we stick with (or at least start with) the simplest solutions. I wholeheartedly agree. As a recovering over-optimizer, I'm now firmly in the simplification camp. An optimized solution will almost certainly have a higher TCO. Yet it is not guaranteed to be better. In fact, 99% of the times, simplification will beat optimization. But unfortunately, as human beings, our evolved brains are wired to seek out optimizations/efficiencies, which makes us veer towards the complex. But we HAVE TO resist that urge and let simplicity win.

Why choose simple over optimal? Because choosing the simplest path makes it easier to get started, keep the momentum going, and ultimately get things done faster. Since there is less cognitive load involved, decisions get made faster. We don't have to tap into our reserves of will-power, [energy](#maximizing-energy) and [focus](#maximizing-focus) either. At work, principles like lean startup, minimum viable product, and the KISS principle are all about starting simple, iterating, and then optimizing later if necessary. Similar strategies can be applied to our personal lives as well.

Keeping things simple is especially important when we're working in a team/organization. The simpler the system, the easier it is to communicate (less room for misinterpretation, ambiguity), the easier it is to onboard new team members, the easier it is to iterate/maintain/improve/automate.

Quick tip: If we're dealing with something that has a high probability of failure anyways, we might as well stick with whatever is simpler.

I now religiously pursue the simplest options in my personal & professional life. It may come at a higher monetary cost; I'm OK with that. It will likely be less efficient; I'm OK with that too. But simple will endure, and that's what matters the most to me. Some examples where I have super-simplified my life via elimination, delegation or automation:

1. Automation: SIP investing, bill payments, recurring subscriptions.

2. Delegation: I hire a CA to handle my complex company-related paperwork (taxes, GST, compliances, etc). I could probably do these myself, but I'd rather spend my time on things that I'm good at. Also, I'd rather not risk messing up my taxes, or missing compliance-related deadlines! 😄

3. Elimination: I've jettisoned a lot of baggage from my life:
   * Caffeine, sugar, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, junk food, processed food, fast food, soda, soft drinks, anything fried, anything with refined flour. Consequently, I eliminate all the side effects & health risks that come from consuming these.
   * I'm trying to eliminate junk food for my brain: twitter, reddit, youtube, instagram, screen time, etc. Not 100% successful yet, but I'm getting there.
   * I don't see any point delving into complex investment instruments (F&O, commodities, REITs, AIFs, T-Bills, G-Secs et al). I've followed the whole "active vs passive" investing debate, and data shows that passive investing in index funds will win out over a 25+ year horizon. So I just stick to the basic index funds (Bogleheads FTW!).
   * I just use Uber/Ola for my commuting needs. I never liked dealing with the baggage that came with owning a car: loan EMIs, registration, insurance, repairs, servicing, parking spots, gas, etc. I'm OK with paying a premium for the convenience of not having to deal with all that.
   * My wardrobe is almost entirely made up of black t-shirt and jeans. Seems a bit excessive, but I have zero cognitive overload while answering the question "what should I wear today?".

Simplicity and minimalism are recurring themes in my life. The more I simplify my life, and eliminate non-essential excesses, the more I'm able to focus on the things that really matter to me.

All said and done, there is definitely a time & place, when you may have to opt for complexity. This usually comes in the later stages AFTER you've nailed the simple, and have outgrown it. At this point, you'll also have a better understanding of the shortcoming/drawbacks of the simple, and the tradeoffs involved in switching from simple to complex.
