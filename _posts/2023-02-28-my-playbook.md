Based on my life experiences, I've cobbled together this playbook that has helped me in my growth/development. This is mostly for my own reference, but I hope it helps you too (disclaimer: I make no guarantees).

Most of the things in this playbook aren't my original ideas; they're mostly things I've imbibed from various books, podcasts, TED talks, YouTube videos, documentaries, friends, mentors, co-workers, and what have you (I've tried to give credit where it's due). But everything in this playbook has been tried, tested and proven to work **for me**. Again, your mileage may vary.

I intend for this to be a living document that I hope to update & tweak every now and then.

## Systems over goals

In my early 30s, I was super-obsessed with hitting goals & checking off bucket-list items: weight goals, marathon running goals, bench/squat/deadlift goals, countries & places to visit, list of books to read, salary goals, job title goals, career goals, restaurants to try out, net worth goals, hobbies to try out, you name it!

I would set goals, and then I would religiously track my progress towards those goals.

And it would ALWAYS end with me getting frustrated!

* Either because I failed to make progress towards those goals.
* Or because I failed to achieve those goals.
* But mostly because I lost track of why I had those goals in the first place.
* Also, if a goal was achieved, my motivation to keep going would just drop off a cliff.

Goals were temporary, they simply didn't endure.

[Scott Adams' advice on 'goals vs systems'](https://www.amazon.in/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/0241003709) was an eye-opener for me. Goals are just a means to an end. They're not the end in themselves.

Instead of creating goals, we need to create systems: something we execute repeatedly, over and over again. The critical word here is 'repeatedly'; the benefits of a system compound only over a long run. There are almost no visible short-term gains, and there almost certainly will be pains in the near term.

For a system to endure, it needs to be consistently executed. The more predictable and boring a system is, the better. The more automated a system is, the better. We have to take will-power out of the equation (cause we only have a very finite supply of it).

With systems, we're creating our personal **pit of success**, that we'll ultimately fall into.

> Aside: The words 'systems', 'habits', 'routines', 'practices', 'rituals, 'frameworks', 'trainings' etc. are all synonyms for me. I use them interchangeably.

-----

I'm not going to regurgitate what Scott Adams has already said in his book, but I'll give a few examples of systems that have worked for me:

Financial systems: Someday, I'll do a deep-dive on these, but for now, I'll just briefly mention them: diversifying income streams, regular SIP investing, creating an emergency fund, creating a succession plan (will), getting insured (health & term/life), and saving on taxes.

Productivity systems: Our productivity is a mostly function of two things: our ability to pick the right things to do, and our ability to getting those things done fast. Some systems that apply here: [taking small bets](#taking-small-bets), [letting simplicity win](#letting-simplicity-win), [conquering fear](#conquering-fear), [maximizing energy](#maximizing-energy), [maximizing focus](#maximizing-focus), [being uncomfortable](#being-uncomfortable) and [applying leverage](#applying-leverage).

> Aside: Yes, some of these systems may seem a bit "out there" (for lack of a better word). I'll expound more on them in the coming sections. Stick with me, it's well worth it. Read on.

## Conquering fear

>
> "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage." - Anais Nin
>

I can attribute most of my growth to doing things that INITIALLY scared me: <@TODO: Examples of fear>

What we loosely term as **fear** is generally a brain cocktail blended from multiple ingredients: anxiety, shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, regret, uncertainty, helplessness, inexperience, unfamiliarity, vulnerability, despair, ego, unhappiness, insecurities, laziness, inertia, mistrust, and many more. Yes, and fear itself.

> Aside: I highly recommend the books by Brené Brown and Chip Conley on many of these fascinating topics.

But know that there is no workaround, we have to take these fears head-on: we have to acknowledge them, define them, face them, and ultimately take action to conquer them.

-----

Two things that have helped me tremendously in dealing with my fears:

1. [Tim Ferris' fear-setting exercise](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI) has been particularly useful in creating a process.

   * First I acknowledge and write down my fears.
   * Then I write down the worst-case scenarios for each fear.
   * Then I write down what I'll do should that worst case scenario ever materialize.

   As an example, I have a (possibly irrationally) paranoia about losing my phone. So I did a simple fear-setting exercise, documenting the worst case outcomes, and the steps that I can take to prevent/mitigate them ([LINK]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-02-25-preparing-for-device-loss %})).

2. [Jeff Bezos recommends having a bias for action](https://youtu.be/NqVoOC2azZI). Take SOME action. ANY action. Basically, just put something into motion.

When dealing with fears, I take solace in these two facts:

1. *Almost EVERYTHING seems scary the first time around*: Driving, swimming, public speaking, asking someone out, hiring someone, purchasing a home, yada yada. Once I take some action, I soon realize that my fears aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.

2. *Most fears are just imaginary/irrational*: As soon as I take some action, I realize that:

   * the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. or
   * the probability of anything bad happening is extremely low. or
   * should anything bad happen I can handle/mitigate it. or
   * should anything bad happen I can recover from it. or
   * I can prevent anything bad from happening in the first place.

The more we face our fears, the more it shrinks.

Crucially, conquering our fears lowers our barrier to taking risks/actions. More on that later.

## Letting simplicity win

>

>
> "Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance." - Coco Chanel

The easiest way to ensure that a "system" endures is to keep it simple. Super, brain-dead simple. The simpler it is, the easier it is to follow that system.

In Scott Adams' book, he dichotomizes people as either simplifiers or as optimizers. And he argues that we'd be better off if we stick with (or at least start with) the simplest solutions. I wholeheartedly agree. As a recovering (over)optimizer, I'm now firmly in the simplification camp. The more optimal solution is not guaranteed to be better. In fact, 99% of the times, simplification will beat optimization. But unfortunately, as human beings, our evolved brains are wired to seek out optimizations/efficiencies, which makes us veer towards the complex. But you HAVE TO resist that urge and let simplicity win.

Why choose simple over optimal? Because choosing the simplest path makes it easier to get started, keep the momentum going, and ultimately get things done faster. Since there is almost no cognitive load involved, decisions get made faster. You don't have to tap into your will-power reserves either.

Why let simplicity win?

* . 
* optimal might have higher TOC. 
* solution should not be more complex than the problem you're trying to solve.
* simplicity is related to energy levels

>
> "That's been one of my mantras – focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex." - Steve Jobs
>

I now religiously pursue the simpler options in life; but it comes with a cost.
- simpler might be more expensive
- simpler might be less efficient (e.g. maybe PMS will beat index funds)
- 

Some examples where I have super-simplified my life:

1. Investing: No point delving into complex investment instruments (F&O, commodities, REITs, AIFs, T-Bills, G-Secs et al). If you've followed the whole "active vs passive" investing debate, then you know that passive investing in index funds will win out over a 25+ year horizon. I just stick to those basics: mostly SIP investing in index funds.

   > Aside: Bogleheads FTW!

2. Clothes:
3. Diet: No caffeine, no sugar, no alcohol, no tobacco, no drugs, no junk food, no processed food, no fast food, no soda, no soft drinks, no junk TV, no junk news, no junk social media, no junk internet, no junk email, no junk phone calls, no junk text messages, no junk mail, no junk ads, no junk anything. simplicity eliminates "baggage"/"side-effects": no alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes, etc
4. Work: The KISS principle. start simple, then optimize = Lean / MVP. Easier to communicate (Always opt for simplicity when communicating to a team/org. Zero ambiguity, clear signal)
5. commute, not owning a car

Simplicity and minimalism are recurring themes in my life. Te more I simplify my life, and eliminate non-essential excesses, the more I'm able to focus on the things that really matter to me.

>

There is a time & place, when you may have to opt for complexity.

* you've outgrown the simple.
* in late stages, when you've nailed simple
* When you full understand the tradeoffs involved in switching from simple to complex.
* if the probability of failure is high, you might as well stuck with simple
* Only when we've exhausted all simpler options, should we start looking at more complex solutions.
