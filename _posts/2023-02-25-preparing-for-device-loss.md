Do y'all have a disaster recovery drill if your devices get lost, stolen, or damaged?

How to prevent misuse if stolen?

Any checklists, best practices for these kinds of scenarios?

Here are some precautions I take:

1. Enable [android's find-my-device](https://www.google.com/android/find/) for all devices (enables remote wipe).

2. Enable [android's google-drive-backup](https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582?hl=en) (enables restoration to another device).

3. Enable whatsapp's google-drive-backup.

4. Explicit screen lock for Whatsapp, payment/finance apps.

5. Note down serial#, IMEI# etc ([helps block device if stolen](http://ceir.gov.in/Home/index.jsp)).

6. 2FA/MFA on all apps (tokens stored with a password manager).

7. Switch from physical SIMs to eSIMs.

Comments? thoughts? suggestions?
